### To Do List App [Live Link](https://to-do-app-seven-navy.vercel.app/)

## Purpose: To practice useState, Context Api, useReducer

- Used useState for State management

- Used onChange handler for inputs

- Implemented "Lifting State Up" strategy for passing props to more components

- Implemented useImmerReducer library of useReducer for increasing readability and use less code

- In later commits Used Context api For avoiding prop drilling

### In this project instead of focusing on UI, my primary focus was on building a strong and scalable React architecture.

### I concentrated on writing clean and efficient React code using proper syntax and best practices, implementing state management with Context API, reducers, and ImmerReducer. I also explored key React concepts such as prop drilling and lifting state up to manage data flow effectively across components.

### This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of component communication, state structure, and maintainable React application design.
